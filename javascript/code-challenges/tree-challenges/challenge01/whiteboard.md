| Writing a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns an array of numbers, but is arranged according to the Binary Tree Data Structure 	| [] => return  null  ,  [one value] => return root is this value, [values] => return [values as binary Tree] like image ![binary Tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree.jpg) 	| calls itself twice per function may have a runtime of O(2^N) 	|
| **Edge cases** 	| **Algorithm** 	| **Code** 	|
| - Empty array - array have one value 	| (1) Declare a function called test01 that takes to arrays (preorder , inorder) (2) check if arrays empty or have one value then (3)  create a value called root that take from first element in preorder because is element is a root for binary Tree (4) create a value called moid it will be index of (inorder) (5) now let root.left to be equal Recursion function with new variables by doing for preorder and inorder slice (6)keep loop and return  root 	| code	|
